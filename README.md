# DMMPTB
DMMPTB (Don't make me push that button) is a short python script that makes use of the Merak API to move a device from one group policy to another.  In its implementation the movement from the normal group policy to the secondary policy blocks youtube and rate limits the device down to 50Kb/s.  Useful tool for unplugging people from the Net and learning how to call APIs.

The Script also makes use of Tkinter to build a simple GUI using the grid manager method to display the GUI.

Enjoy!
