# DMMPTB
DMMPTB (Don't make me push that button) is a short python script that makes use of the Merak API to move a device from one group policy to another.  In its implementation the movement from one Group Policy to another show cases what you can do quick and simply with the Meraki Dashboard API.  It also has a practical use if you want to apply a group policy to a device without needing to login to the dashboard.  Useful tool for unplugging people from the Net and learning how to call APIs all in one script!

The Script also makes use of Tkinter to build a simple GUI using the grid manager method to display the GUI to make the use of the script that much easier.

Enjoy!
